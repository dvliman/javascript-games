Javascript Games
================
A collection of my javascript games I wrote back in college
Nothing here, move on

1. Tron
   A snake like game where the players have to
   cut off each other using motor bikes that 
   leaves a line behind them 

   Deployed to Google Chrome webstore:

2. Tactictoe
   A tic tac toe game with minimax algorithm 

3. Reverse-tictactoe
   You win by trying to lose!
   I found it online. I didn't make it.
   I republished to Google Chrome apps

4. Rot 
   Simple letter substitution cipher so I could talk 
   to my geek friend on facebook and leave people
   wondering.
